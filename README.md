## 📖 About  
Have you ever repeated the same workouts with the same weight for weeks, unsure how to increase or what other movements to do?  
I had this happen multiple times over the summer of 2025.  

Not wanting to spend time researching the “best” workouts or paying for subscription-based plans, I created **Gym Journal**—an app where you can:  
- Easily track and manage your workouts  
- Receive feedback that helps you improve  
- Stay consistent without the guesswork

- 🏋️ Intelligent suggestions for progressive overload  
- 📝 Log custom exercises and notes  
- 📊 Visualize progress over time
